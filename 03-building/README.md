# Master Front End IX - Laboratory - Module 3 - Bundling

## Basic

*IMPORTANT*: you must upload these practices to your Github repository (or if you prefer Gitlab or public Bitbucket).

Implement a simple application that:

- Have the bundling mounted by webpack.

- Shows a logo (for example the lemoncode or whatever you want).

- It's mounted with Typescript.

- have the "hello world" text, styled with SASS.

## Optional

- Show a "hello world" developed by React.

- Has a production build version.

- Has an environment variables for production development.

- That we have a way to measure how much each library occupies and our code in the bundle.

- Assemble the same with parcel.

### Bonus points

Alternatively, or as additional points, you can propose to develop some of the challenges proposed in class, or propose yourself some:

- Spanish translations of the MDs.

- Repo contributions to webpack by sample .

- Implementation of some of the issues proposed in the repo (hmr, webpack proxy, ...)
