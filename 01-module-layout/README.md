## Master Front End IX - Laboratory - Module 1 - Layout

Intro

You can follow the instructions on this [pdf](./lab.pdf).

## Exercise 1

Create a dynamic color palette.

- Use the SASS language to create different color palette themes.

- The idea is to start from a base color, and from that color generate 4 darker colors gradually, and four lighter colors gradually.

- To check that everything is working as expected use the html of the statement (look at pdf).

## Exercise 2

Create two different themes and display the results on one page.

Changes to the theme affect the following features:

- Color

- Source

- Border radius

- Shadow box

To view the changes it should be sufficient to import one theme or another into the main style file.

## Exercise 3

Create the image navigation bar using flexbox

- The html is completely open, i.e. create the necessary structures that are deemed suitable.

- The navigation bar responds to different resolutions. Use media queries to achieve this result.

- Look at the pdf to see the result of the different resolutions.

## Exercise 4

We will create a card type element with CSS Grid.

The alignments should be done with this feature, but the html is totally open (look at pdf).
